# StillGood

StillGood is a new programming language, designed to capitalize on the strengths of both functional and object oriented programming paradigms.

## Setup

(setup for developers, for now)

1. Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. Clone this repository.
3. In repository, run `stack build`.
4. Run `stack exec StillGood filename` where 'filename' is your test program.
5. Alternatively you can run `stack ghci` to work with GHC's interactive environment.
