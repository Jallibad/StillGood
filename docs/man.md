# StillGood

## Introduction

#### What IS StillGood?
StillGood is a new programming language designed to capitalize on the strengths
of both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is based on 
lambda calculus and features Haskell style function application.

StillGood features a Hindley-Milner type system. It is statically typed with
type inference and parametric polymorphism.

StillGood is built in both Haskell and Python. Haskell is used for parsing and
lexing via the Megaparsec library. Python is used for code generation and compilation
via LLVM.

Currently, basic functionality is working. A simple function will compile and execute.
Future work intends to build off of this and implement more features.
